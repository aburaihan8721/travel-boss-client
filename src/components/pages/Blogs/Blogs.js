              <h4>The soul of adventure</h4>
              <p>
                What defines adventure? For me it’s very simple: the very possibility of death, as remote as it may
                be, is what makes any activity adventurous. In that sense life itself is an epic adventure but I’ve
                always been driven by pushing the envelope by living a life on the edge. My quest has taken me to
                some of the remotest and most hostile environments on Earth including many places where no human
                had ever been before. I’ve been on top of the world – atop Mt Everest

                after 40 years, I still feel the same sense of awe before every climb as I did back then wondering
                if I’ll make it to the top and what discoveries I’ll make along the way. Climbing is as much a
                battle against the elements as it is with your own self: you push your body and understand its
                limitations; discover your inner strength; and eventually purge your soul. And out there, in the
                icy vertical world of the highest mountain peaks of our planet, you discover freedom in its truest
                form, where every step into the unknown is a willful act of discovery.

                Approaching the imposing Sofitel St James hotel just off Pall Mall in St James, I felt compelled to
                stop and stare for a long lingering moment to enjoy its stunning Grade II-listed neoclassical
                fa√ßade. Part of AccorHotels the building is just beautiful. It was designed by E. Keynes Purchase
                in association with Durward Brown and was completed in 1923. It had a long life as a bank for many
                years before the French hotel group took it over and turned it into this fabulous hotel.

                The dark marble reception desk with its green cushioned backdrop and seemingly sky-high ceilings
                suggest that pleasure is a serious business delivered with precision. Staff are amazingly attentive
                and as this is a French hotel you are greeted in both French and English. Checking in is easy and
                my bags were taken to my room without any prompting. Later a text popped up on my WhatsApp asking
                if I was happy with my room. A nice touch.
